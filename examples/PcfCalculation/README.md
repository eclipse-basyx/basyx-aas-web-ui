# PCF Calculation

This example demonstrates the `PCF Process` Module in the AAS Web UI. The module allows users to select a product shell (`assetkind`=`Type`) for a product that is being manufactured. A PCF calculation will take place based on selected materials resulting in a product instance shell (`assetkind`=`Instance`) with a calculated PCF Submodel.

## Getting started

You can run the provided example using Docker Compose. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-basyx/basyx-aas-web-ui.git
    cd basyx-aas-web-ui/examples/PcfCalculation
    ```

2. Start the setup with Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the AAS Web UI in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. Navigate to the `PCF Process` module via the main menu
