# AAS Web UI Modules

This directory contains extension modules for the AAS Web UI.

Vue components added here will be automatically registered with the AAS Web UI and provided as own page via the AAS Web UI navigation.  
Modules can reference/use vue components that are located in the [components](../../components/) directory.  
This way, you can create reusable components that can be used in multiple modules.
